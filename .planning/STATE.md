# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Any colleague can go from a use case description to deployed, tested agents on Orq.ai -- through an automated pipeline with real-time visibility and HITL approvals -- without needing to understand the underlying AI platform.
**Current focus:** Between milestones -- V4.0 not yet started
**Previous milestones:** v0.3 shipped 2026-03-01 (11 phases, 28 plans), V2.0 shipped 2026-03-02 (7 phases, 11 plans), V2.1 shipped 2026-03-13 (8 phases, 9 plans)

## Current Position

Phase: No active phase (V4.0 not started)
Plan: N/A
Status: Between milestones
Last activity: 2026-03-23 - Completed quick task 260323-gex: Create /orq-agent:systems command for managing IT systems registry

Progress: V2.1 complete. V4.0 next.

## Performance Metrics

No active phase metrics. V4.0 not yet started.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- systems.md uses markdown format (not JSON) for maximum user editability -- user-configurable IT systems registry (2026-03-23)
- Browser automation installer default is "none" to keep setup frictionless for users who don't need it (2026-03-23)
- REVISED: workflow-discovery agent (NEW) sits after discussion, before architect -- conversational system identification replaces architect-embedded detection (2026-03-23)
- REVISED: workflow-builder replaces SOP-dependent approach -- conversation is primary input, screenshots secondary, SOP optional (2026-03-23)
- REVISED: architect priority MEDIUM (not HIGH) -- receives workflow-discovery output, no longer performs detection (2026-03-23)
- 3 new subagents for browser automation: workflow-discovery, workflow-builder, script-generator (2026-03-23)
- MCP tool as integration surface for browser automation -- test/iterate/harden pipeline unchanged (2026-03-23)
- Direct Claude messages.create() over Agent SDK -- pipeline stages are predetermined, not agent-decided
- GitHub raw URL for .md file fetching with PIPELINE_REPO_RAW_URL env var -- runtime fetching per user decision
- Vitest for test framework -- ESM-native, fast, TypeScript out of the box

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
