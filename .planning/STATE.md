# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Any colleague can go from a use case description to deployed, tested agents on Orq.ai -- through an automated pipeline with real-time visibility and HITL approvals -- without needing to understand the underlying AI platform.
**Current focus:** V3.0 Lifecycle Completeness & Eval Science — defining requirements
**Previous milestones:** v0.3 shipped 2026-03-01 (11 phases, 28 plans), V2.0 shipped 2026-03-02 (7 phases, 11 plans), V2.1 shipped 2026-03-13 (8 phases, 9 plans)

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-04-20 — Milestone V3.0 started

Progress: V2.1 complete. V3.0 milestone being defined. V4.0/V5.0 deferred behind V3.0.

## Performance Metrics

No active phase metrics. V4.0 not yet started.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- systems.md uses markdown format (not JSON) for maximum user editability -- user-configurable IT systems registry (2026-03-23)
- Browser automation installer default is "none" to keep setup frictionless for users who don't need it (2026-03-23)
- REVISED: workflow-discovery agent (NEW) sits after discussion, before architect -- conversational system identification replaces architect-embedded detection (2026-03-23)
- REVISED: workflow-builder replaces SOP-dependent approach -- conversation is primary input, screenshots secondary, SOP optional (2026-03-23)
- REVISED: architect priority MEDIUM (not HIGH) -- receives workflow-discovery output, no longer performs detection (2026-03-23)
- 3 new subagents for browser automation: workflow-discovery, workflow-builder, script-generator (2026-03-23)
- MCP tool as integration surface for browser automation -- test/iterate/harden pipeline unchanged (2026-03-23)
- Direct Claude messages.create() over Agent SDK -- pipeline stages are predetermined, not agent-decided
- GitHub raw URL for .md file fetching with PIPELINE_REPO_RAW_URL env var -- runtime fetching per user decision
- Vitest for test framework -- ESM-native, fast, TypeScript out of the box
- [Phase quick-260326-ann]: evaluatorq is NOT legacy -- use with caution for local custom scoring; REST is primary experiment path

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
