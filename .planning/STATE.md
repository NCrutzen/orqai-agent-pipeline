# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** Any colleague can go from a use case description to deployed, tested agents on Orq.ai -- through a browser UI with real-time visibility, visual agent graphs, and in-app approvals -- without touching a terminal or needing technical knowledge.
**Current focus:** V7.0 Agent OS -- Phase 51 Hero Components (Phase 50 code-complete, migration apply deferred pending Management API token)
**Previous milestones:** v0.3 shipped 2026-03-01, V2.0 shipped 2026-03-02, V2.1 shipped 2026-03-13, V3.0 in progress (91%), V4.0 partially complete, V6.0 phases 44-45 complete

## Current Position

Phase: 50 of 54 (Data Pipeline)
Plan: 50-02 complete, Phase 51 next
Status: Phase 50 code-complete, migration apply + end-to-end verify deferred
Last activity: 2026-04-16

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 43% (3 of 7 V7.0 phases code-complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: --
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

| Phase 48 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 9 files |

### Decisions

- V7.0 uses parallel CSS namespace (--v7-*) to coexist with existing shadcn tokens
- Azure AD must use OAuth (not SAML) to auto-link existing email/password accounts
- Single Supabase Realtime subscription per swarm view, not per component
- Orq.ai data flows through Inngest cron to Supabase, never client-to-Orq.ai
- Ring buffers from day one for terminal stream and delegation graph (max 500 events)
- Design reference: docs/designs/agent-dashboard-v2.html
- V7 foundation tables use single migration file (logically coupled)
- Supabase Management API for migrations (proven reliable, no CLI dependency)
- [Phase 48]: V7 tokens in existing globals.css with --v7-* prefix, @custom-variant uses [data-theme='dark']

### Blockers/Concerns

- Azure AD tenant setup has organizational dependencies (IT admin access)
- Supabase Management API token expired -- Phase 50 migration apply blocked (seed update also needs this or Studio access)
- Supabase Realtime plan limits need verification (carry forward from Phase 49)

### Outstanding Verification (Deferred)

- **Phase 48-03 Azure AD SSO end-to-end** -- Code is in place (SSO button, access-pending page, project_members gate, middleware exemption) but human verification blocked on Azure AD tenant provisioning + Supabase Azure provider config. Full 8-step verification protocol in `.planning/phases/48-foundation/48-03-SUMMARY.md` under "Deferred: Human Verification (Task 3)". Resume signal: "SSO verified".
- **Phase 50 Data Pipeline migration apply + end-to-end** -- Migration file written and committed (`supabase/migrations/20260416_trace_sync.sql`) but Supabase Management API token in repo is expired. User must apply via Studio SQL editor OR provide a current `sbp_*` token so the next session can run it. Then seed one `projects.orqai_project_id` on a real swarm to kick off the cron. Full protocol in `.planning/phases/50-data-pipeline/50-VERIFICATION.md` under "Deferred: Human Verification". Resume signal: "Phase 50 sync verified".

### Pending Todos

5 pending (see `.planning/todos/pending/`):
- Plan V3 milestones for Playwright and next project phase (planning)
- Build Zapier analytics browser automation (automation)
- Resolve PostgREST exposed-schemas for email_insights (database)
**Debtor-email sub-project — 4 todos, clearly separated:**
- **Intent agent for unknown-bucket debtor mails** (swarm design → `/orq-agent`) — LLM on top of regex classifier's `unknown` fall-through
- **fetchDocument tool** (engineering) — Vercel API route using Zapier SDK for NXT SQL + S3. No swarm involvement.
- **createIcontrollerDraft tool** (engineering) — Vercel API route using Browserless+Playwright. Selectors captured from 2026-04-22 probe.
- **Copy-document sub-agent** (swarm design → `/orq-agent`) — consumes the two tool contracts above. Blocked on both tools existing.

**Tomorrow's first pickup:** build the two engineering tools in parallel (fetcher + drafter). Once both HTTP endpoints are live + registered as Orq.ai tool-calls, fill the swarm brief with data samples and invoke `/orq-agent` for the swarm spec.
